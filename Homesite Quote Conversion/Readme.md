# Homesite Quote Conversion

This project focuses on predicting the probability that a customer will purchase a quoted insurance plan. The dataset, sourced from a Kaggle competition, involves a binary classification problem aimed at improving customer conversion rates.

Dataset available at: [Homesite Quote Conversion Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion)

---

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a quoted insurance plan, leveraging Python's Scikit-learn library and advanced techniques such as ensemble methods and SMOTE.

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Using SMOTE to address class imbalance for better minority class prediction.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Implementing stacking with multiple models for improved accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing models for best performance using grid search and other techniques.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing individual and stacked models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Kaggle Submissions:** Submitting predictions for benchmarking and performance comparison.

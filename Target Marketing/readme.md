# Target Marketing

This project focuses on classifying and identifying target customer segments for effective marketing campaigns using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate predictive models while exploring hyperparameter tuning and comparing different approaches for optimization.

---

## Objective
To develop and evaluate classification models for predicting target marketing outcomes, leveraging Python's Scikit-learn library, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced evaluation metrics.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** 
  - Performed grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
  - Experimented with different hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth, splitting criterion, number of estimators) for Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Compared the performance of different tuning methods and identified the best model for each criterion.

- **Classification Models:**
  - Built Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to solve the Target Marketing problem.
  - Constructed models with optimized hyperparameters for improved performance.

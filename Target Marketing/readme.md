# Target Marketing

This project focuses on classifying and identifying customer segments for effective marketing campaigns using machine learning techniques. The dataset provides features that help in understanding customer behavior and predicting the likelihood of a customer responding to a marketing strategy.

---

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that classify and segment customers based on their likelihood of responding to a marketing campaign, using Python's Scikit-learn library and advanced modeling techniques.

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, identifying relevant and irrelevant features, and analyzing feature importance.
- **Classification Models:** Building and comparing Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for target marketing.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experimenting with parameters to optimize the models using grid search, random search, and Bayes search methods.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Kaggle Submissions:** Submitting predictions to Kaggle for benchmarking and score comparison.

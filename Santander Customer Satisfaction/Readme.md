# Santander Customer Satisfaction

This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from a Kaggle competition, involves a binary classification problem where the target variable indicates whether a customer is satisfied or unsatisfied.

## Objective
To explore and build machine learning models for predicting customer satisfaction, focusing on using Python's Scikit-learn library, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and decision tree classifiers.

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Analyzing data distributions, identifying patterns, and determining feature relevance.
  - Identifying irrelevant features and justifying their exclusion.

- **Decision Tree Classifier:**
  - Training and validating decision tree models.
  - Exploring the impact of changing parameters such as tree depth, splitting criterion, and leaf nodes.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Experimenting with multiple parameter configurations to optimize model performance.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Using metrics like accuracy and Kaggle rankings to evaluate and compare models.
  - Creating an Excel table to summarize results from different models.

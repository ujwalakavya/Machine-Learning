# Santander Customer Satisfaction

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction using machine learning techniques. The dataset, provided by Kaggle, involves a binary classification problem where the target variable indicates whether a customer is satisfied or unsatisfied.

---

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that predict customer satisfaction, leveraging Python's Scikit-learn library and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing data distribution, identifying patterns, and understanding feature importance.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Training and tuning decision tree models to improve predictive performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experimenting with parameters like tree depth, splitting criterion, and maximum leaf nodes to optimize the model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy and Kaggle scores to evaluate model performance.
- **Kaggle Submissions:** Submitting predictions to Kaggle for benchmarking and comparison.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Regression Models:** Implementing multiple regression techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experimenting with parameters to optimize model performance using grid search and random search.
- **Feature Selection:** Using methods like SelectFromModel and SequentialFeatureSelector to identify important features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing regression models based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ².
- **Kaggle Submissions:** Submitting predictions for benchmarking and comparison.
